# Changelog

## v1.8.8
- Shared PNG: the long IPv6 Target line soft-wraps onto the next line inside the exported image too, so it no longer runs past the right edge

- Header: long IPv6 target lines now wrap onto the next line instead of being cut off
- Shared PNG: ad text moved to the footer right corner (left of the QR code)

- Shared PNG: footer now includes a QR code pointing to https://www.say.cc

## v1.8.5
- Fixed: History was empty unless STOP was pressed — every run is now recorded at the end of its first completed cycle
- Removed: packet-loss vibrate (feature and setting fully removed; VIBRATE permission dropped)

## v1.8.4
